                <h1> My name is Tyler Ritone. I am currently enrolled in UCF's coding bootcamp. I have spent the past 7 years expanding my experiences in life and developing a solid foundation for future work. I was a project manager for an interior/exterior house painting company until I developed the knowledge to build my own business. The painting industry helped me find my love for creation. The project management and business ownership helped tailor my abilities to utilize time-management, organization and customer service skills. These experiences have led me to coding. My love for creation was limited in my past field with putting colors on homes. As amazing as that is, I prefer a larger and more unique world full of imagination and creativity where anything is possible... So, I chose the endlessly growing tech industry.</h1>
